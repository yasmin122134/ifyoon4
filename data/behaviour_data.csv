quick backstory three months ago he had a total of  seizures in  hours we took him to the vet to get blood work and there was nothing abnormal they mentioned if it continued we could run a ct scan and go to neurology no more seizures happened so we were hopeful it was just a bug bite or something he ate

fast forward to two days ago and he has them again this time i think they are worse than before the last seizure lasted about  minutes and took him  hours to stop panting and go back to normal

does anyone have experience with this i realize theres some underlying issue but do you know if going down the road of neurology and ct scans is worth it all

since the episode the  year old will randomly run at and growl and nip the  year old he wont actually bite him but he is being very unfriendly yesterday he rammed the  year old into a wall the  year old is a pretty jealous and neurotic pup so im wondering if its just jealously or is it some animalistic type of end of life dominance 

has anyone seen anything like this any advice they still sleep together walk together the majority of the day until the  year old strikes at random and the  year old doesnt react at all when attacked",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

62,,"my wife and i are expecting our first child in a few months 

we have a  year old lb golden retriever and a  year old  lb rottweiler both are very sweet and have never shown an ounce of aggressive outside of the rottweiler chasing squirrels in the yard 

while they arent aggressive they can be excitable  jumping pawing licking mostly when people greet them theyre trained but still have that tendency and are big dogs 

i am worried about the integration of the baby with them what is the best way to introduce the baby and ensure they know boundaries with the baby",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
