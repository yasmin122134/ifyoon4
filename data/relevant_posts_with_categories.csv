he will come up to me and make whiny noises but when i pet him to calm him down his whining intensifies to a point where hes barking loudly at me he will just look me in the eye and bark 

his food and water dishes are constantly full he doesnt want to go outside when i open the door nothing he just wants to bark at me for some reason 

at that point i pull back and shun him to show that i dont approve of that behavior he used to chill out and sit next to me but now hes getting too riled up

this is a new thing in the past week he has barked and chased three dogs while out walking hes never done this before as hes always liked to be with other dogs and liked to play 

he stayed with relatives while i was on holiday and they only walk him on lead but since hes been home i walk him as normal hes on lead if other dogs are also on lead and off if others are off his recall is good most of the time as he gets a treatpraise for returning 

im worried that hes suddenly getting annoyed with dogs that are not being aggressive towards him not showing anything but wanting to play

he stayed with relatives while i was on holiday and they only walk him on lead but since hes been home i walk him as normal hes on lead if other dogs are also on lead and off if others are off his recall is good most of the time as he gets a treatpraise for returning 

im worried that hes suddenly getting annoyed with dogs that are not being aggressive towards him not showing anything but wanting to play 

any help or ideas are much appreciated as he likes to run and i dont want to resort to him being on lead constantly because of his behaviourattitude chase",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
